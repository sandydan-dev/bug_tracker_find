                                   BugTrack

🐞 What is a Bug/Issue Tracker Project?
This project helps teams track bugs, issues, or tasks in software development — just like how companies use Jira or GitHub Issues.

✅ Why build this project?
It’s used in every real software company

Shows you understand roles, permissions, and ticket systems

Great for practicing auth, API building, and database relationships

It’s perfect to add in your resume as a real-world system

🎯 What does it actually do?
Users (like testers or customers) can report a bug

Developers can get assigned to fix it

Tickets have status like “open”, “in progress”, “done”

People can comment on the issue to discuss it

👥 Who uses it?
Reporters → create the issue

Developers → solve the issue

Admins → manage everything


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Why Build a Bug/Issue Tracker?
✅ Real-World Problem:
Every software team faces bugs, feature requests, or tasks during development. Without organization, it's hard to track:

Who reported a bug?

Who is fixing it?

What is its status?

What priority is it?

Has it been discussed?

When will it be fixed?

This is where a bug tracking system like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Issues comes in. But instead of using those, you’re going to build your own backend system for this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Purpose of This Project
✅ Build a real-world backend that solves an actual software engineering problem
✅ Understand how to model users, permissions, tasks, and comments
✅ Gain experience with REST APIs, relational databases, authentication, validation, error handling, etc.
✅ Learn how to organize a backend like professionals do

This project proves you can:

Create a scalable API

Manage relationships (users-tickets-comments)

Handle multiple roles (admin, developer, reporter)

Secure endpoints

Do validations and proper error handling

Follow backend folder structures used by real teams
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
🏗️ System Overview (How It Works)
Let’s imagine you’re a developer in a team. Your team is building a website. Bugs appear.

You open the issue tracker:

Create a ticket like “Login page not working”

Assign it to a dev

Mark it as In Progress

Add a comment like “Caused by missing JWT”

Mark it Resolved when fixed

Everything is trackable. Now imagine:

Multiple users working

Comments and priorities

Filtering tickets

Admin managing all issues

This is exactly what we’ll build.

what is tickets


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let’s break it down clearly and simply.

🐞 What is a Ticket in a Bug/Issue Tracker?
✅ A ticket is just a record of a problem, a task, or a feature request.
Think of a ticket like a digital sticky note that helps a team track what needs to be done.

🎯 Example of a Ticket:

Field	Example
Title	Login button not working
Description	When clicking the login button, nothing happens on the frontend.
Priority	High
Status	Open / In Progress / Done
Created By	john@example.com (the reporter)
Assigned To	dev@example.com (the developer)
Due Date	2025-04-30
🧠 Real-Life Purpose:
In a real software team:

Tester or User finds a bug → creates a ticket

Developer is assigned → fixes the bug

Project Manager tracks the progress

Admin oversees all tickets

🎯 So in your backend project:
A ticket will be a PostgreSQL row stored in a tickets table with fields like:

title

description

status

priority

createdBy

assignedTo

createdAt

💡 Bonus:
You can also add:

Comments: Users/devs discuss the issue on the ticket

Tags: “UI Bug”, “Security”, “Performance”

Attachments: Screenshots (if needed)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you're trying to say — you're talking about adding a 1-to-1 chat system inside your Bug/Issue Tracker, where:

🗨️ Only the user who created the ticket and the developer assigned to it can privately chat about that specific issue.

This is an amazing idea — it makes your project feel even more real, like Jira or GitHub + Slack combined. Here's how and where to add it 👇

💬 Where to Add 1-to-1 Chat in Bug Tracker Project
📁 Add a New Model: Message
Create a Message model in your backend with fields like:

senderId

receiverId

ticketId (to link it to the issue)

text (the actual message)

timestamp

📁 Optional: Conversation Model
If you want to manage chats separately, you can also create a Conversation model to manage participants and the issue.

🔌 Where Socket.IO Comes In
Use Socket.IO for real-time message sending:

Emit an event like sendMessage

Backend listens, saves it to DB, and emits to the right user in real-time (like WhatsApp)

🔐 When & Why to Use It

Question	Answer
✅ When to Use	Once a ticket has been created and assigned to a developer
🎯 Why to Use	To allow private discussion about that specific bug/task
🔐 Who can message whom	Only the ticket creator and the assigned developer
🛠️ Where to show it	In the frontend UI (optional), or test it using Postman or Socket.IO frontend
🤩 Why This Is a Killer Feature
Makes your backend feel like Slack + Jira

Shows you understand real-time communication

Great for interview demos — "this issue has its own private chat"

Helps devs clarify bugs quickly, no need for comments or emails
